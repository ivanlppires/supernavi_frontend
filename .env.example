# Lab setup:
#   1. Edge host: mkcert -install && mkcert supernavi-edge.local
#   2. Place cert.pem/key.pem in supernavi_edge/caddy/certs/
#   3. Client machines: install mkcert root CA for trusted HTTPS
#      - Windows: certutil -addstore -user Root rootCA.pem
#      - macOS: sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain rootCA.pem
#   4. Ensure supernavi-edge.local resolves (mDNS or /etc/hosts)
